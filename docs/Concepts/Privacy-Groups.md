# Privacy Groups 

When [transactions are sent](../Reference/API-Methods.md#send) to: 

* List of recipients, Orion creates a privacy group containing the recipients 
* Privacy group, the transaction is distributed to all members of the privacy group. 

Hyperledger Besu maintains a [private state per privacy group](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups/). 

Endpoints are provided to create, delete, and privacy groups: 

* [createPrivacyGroup](../Reference/API-Methods.md#createprivacygroup) 
* [deletePrivacyGroup](../Reference/API-Methods.md#deleteprivacygroup)
* [findPrivacyGroup](../Reference/API-Methods.md#findprivacygroup)
